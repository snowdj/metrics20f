0. [Slides (Part 1)](../lectures/topic7-joint_distributions.pdf); [Slides (Part 2)](../lectures/topic7-joint_distributions02.pdf)

1.	Basic Definitions (CB, chapter 4.1.)

2.	Quantify relationship between two variables 

    a.	Independence (CB, chapter 4.2. pages 152-156)
    
    b.	Covariance and Correlation (CB, chapter 4.5)

3.	**Special Case**: Multivariate Normal (see also BH, chapters 5.7-5.8; Bruce Hansenâ€™s notes Chapter 5.2.). Note that we will use this result in various settings such as derivation of the exact finite sample distribution of OLS estimator.
