## Outline

1. Motivation and Basic Definitions 

    1. Motivating Numerical Example
    2. Derivation of Formal Definition
        
        - Discrete Cases
        - Continuous Cases
        - More than two variables
    
    3. Alterantive Definitions (linking to means)
    
2. Special Conditional Distributions

    1. Multivariate Normal Distribution
        
        - Conditional Distribution
        - Conditional Mean
        - Conditional Variance
        
    2. Truncated Distribution
    
        - Definition
        - Derivation 
        - Mean of a truncated distribution
        - A special truncated distribution: Truncated Normal (distribution, mean, and variance)
